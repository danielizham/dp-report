% Thank the RC club

All praise and gratitude belongs to Allah, the one God 
and the Almighty, for having made all the circumstances 
right for us to finish this project successfully.

First and foremost, we would like to thank none other than
our beloved supervisor, Dr. Amr Mahmoud. Despite his busy
schedule, he was there
week in week out to answer our questions, listen to our
troubles, and suggest constructive criticisms. 

We must not forget our families, whom we have sacrificed 
the time to be with in order that we complete this project
in time. We are
sorry for the many eat-outs we have had to pass, 
for the frequent conversations we have had to cut short,
and for the numerous family activities we have had to miss,
all for the fear of deadlines staring at our faces.
We regret being so weak to forget our priorities in life.

Finally, we thank each other for all the collaboration
and contributions. We appreciate the role each of us
has played throughout this project.

A part of this project report has been published as a manuscript and
accepted for the The International Wireless Communications \& Mobile
Computing Conference (\textsc{iwcmc} 2022) with \textsc{id} 1570797868.
