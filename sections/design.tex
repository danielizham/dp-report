    In this section, you need to document the detailed 
    design specifications of the hardware and software 
    subsystems used in your design to meet the functional 
    requirements and the practical design constraints of 
    your project. You should document your detailed design 
    using suitable methods and tools such as circuit 
    diagrams, logic diagrams, block diagrams, flow charts, 
    class diagrams and sequence diagrams. Also you need to 
    provide detailed justification of design choices. 
    Additionally, you should highlight the novel aspects 
    of your design. Additionally, you should also evaluate 
    the effect of design choices on your system quality 
    attributes.You could consider breaking this section 
    into the sub-sections listed below.  Note that you are 
    not required to include all of these sub-sections, 
    instead you need to decide how to best communicate 
    your solutionâ€™s design.
