The overview of the proposed solution is depicted in 
\cref{fig:solution-overview}. 
The hardware components consist of an \anafi drone,
a Raspberry Pi with an external battery, and a Wi-Fi
dongle. The built-in camera of the drone is used to
take pictures of the targets and the Wi-Fi dongle
is used to communicate with the command and control
system, which sends high-level commands whenever the
connection is present. An object detection model trained
using RoboFlow detects and identifies the targets in the
pictures. In addition, a \gls{drl} agent is trained 
in a cyber-physical simulator called Sphinx to
visit virtual targets having the same mobility pattern as the
real ones.
This finished model is loaded into the Raspberry Pi that acts
as an onboard computer to the \anafi drone and instructs
it where to move to cover the targets in a minimum amount
of time.

The following subsections will
explain in more detail why this solution is chosen
and what the integral components are.

\end{figure}

\subsection{High level architecture}

\Cref{fig:arch-fig} shows a high-level architecture 
of the complete working system, in which a group 
of connected adapters and devices are combined into 
a single functional system. 
The architecture is composed of three sections namely
interfacing, controlling, and targets. 
The interfacing section contains the drone that 
will handle the onboard computer, its power source, 
and the connection adapters. 
In the controlling part, a personal computer 
will be responsible for contacting the onboard computer 
to adjust settings, execute scripts, and get 
live updates and results. 
Finally, there are multiple moving targets 
in the target section. For example, 
\gls{rc} cars are controlled manually and move in 
a specific mobility pattern with varying directions 
and destinations. 
In the next section, hardware and software components 
will be presented in a more detailed manner.

        and the \textbf{scientific principles of its 
        inner working}.

\subsubsection{Software}

There are three primary categories of software 
depending on the usage: simulation, training, 
and application, and they are listed in \cref{tab:software-used}. The first part will focus on 
simulating the environment, testing the models, 
and flight control. Before discussing the software 
to be used, we have selected Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) 
as an operating system for several reasons. 
One key reason is that in addition to
still being supported, it is compatible with the 
Parrot's Olympe and Sphinx programs, which are only 
supported on limited distributions and operating systems.
Another reason is that it is a lite \textsc{os} 
and can be installed on the onboard computer that 
will be attached to the drone. For the simulation part, 
using Sphinx and Gazebo software is very helpful
to visualize the environment, control the drone, 
and apply the \gls{drl} model.

Sphinx is a simulation 
tool built on top of Gazebo 
to run the Parrot's drone firmware on 
personal computers, which comes with helpful 
features for simulation such as visualizing flight 
data at runtime, running the \gls{uav} remotely, 
and executing scripts with the command line. 
Gazebo is a robot \textsc{gui} simulation 
which simulates the visual and physical surrounding 
of drones and custom 3D objects. 
\Cref{fig:gazebo} shows how the Sphinx 
program looks like. 

\begin{figure}[tbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gazebo.png}
    \caption{The Sphinx program that runs on top of Gazebo.}
    \label{fig:gazebo}
\end{figure}

The training part is divided into \gls{rl}, 
which is used to teach the \anafi drone to complete the task, 
and object detection and identification, 
which is used to detect and count the targets
required in determining the reward during the training. 
The \gls{rl} agent is based on the \gls{drl} model 
developed by \textcite{Ged21}. The action space is composed 
of 9 movements in the 
forward, backward, left,
right, forward-left, forward-right, backward-left and 
backward-right directions as well as a hover.
The state space is given as
\begin{align}
    s = \{ t, cell, [ I_1, I_2, I_3, \ldots, I_m] \} 
    \label{eq:state-space}
\end{align}

\noindent 
where $t$ is the current time step, $cell$ is the \id of the
cell above which the drone is, $I_k$ is the binary variable 
that indicates if the target with an \id of $k$ has been
visited, $m$ is the total number of targets,
and the vector of length $m$ is the container for the
$I$ indicators. 
For example,
if only targets with \id's 3 and 7 have been visited
in the current and previous time steps since the beginning of the 
episode,
then the vector will have elements of one for $I_3$ and $I_7$ while
the other elements are zeros.
It follows that all the targets must be uniquely identifiable.
In addition, the reward is how many new targets are captured 
in the current cell,
and if the drone flies past the boundary, then a big negative
reward will be incurred.

For the object detection, we used simulation tools to 
generate some training datasets. Firstly, 
we placed random objects and captured the images 
using the simulated drone camera. We have used a 
website called Roboflow which helped us labelling 
the objects and generate new datasets from the 
existing ones with different types of augmentation 
such as rotation and scaling. 
For the object detection model, Google Colab notebook 
was a sufficient tool to start training using 
\gls{cnn} \textsc{yolo}v5 in addition to the 
Jupyter notebook which was very helpful 
in code experimentation. 

For the application software, Parrot Olympe 
was used to send commands to the physical as well as 
the simulated drone and control the flight trip and 
how the drone moves. Parrot Olympe uses Python 
controller programming interface for Parrot drones 
which makes controlling simple and easy using a 
Python script. Moreover, Olympe allows us to read
sensor data, such as the \gls{gps} fixes and camera feed, 
from the \anafi
drone. This will make it possible to build a user interface
on the control and command station to monitor 
the progress of the drone
when it is autonomously executing the task visitation
mission.



\subsubsection{Hardware}

The main core of the hardware part is the drone, 
which will be the Parrot \anafi.
\Cref{tab:hardware-used} lists the hardware components
used in this project and their justifications. This quad-copter
drone is powerful because it combines many technologies 
and sensors in a small foldable size. It also it has 4K HDR Camera supported 
with 180 degree gimbal. 
There are seven sensors in total inside the drone which are shown in 
\cref{tab:sensors-table} 


\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{Processor and sensors inside the drone}
	\label{tab:sensors-table}

		image processing , video encoding , interfacing \\

		3-axis accelerometer
		& measure the acceleration in 3 dimensions  \\

		& determine the location of the drone and navigation  \\

		&  height measurement for small height less than 5 meters  \\ 
				Vertical camera 
		&  measuring horizontal speed and height using optical flow \\ 
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}   

The second important device is the Raspberry Pi 4 model B. It 
acts as an onboard computer and is used in this project
mainly to facilitate the low-level control of the drone
by sending frequent control commands to the drone
in a certain direction or stay hovering.
The choice of action is determined by the \gls{drl}
model that will be installed in it.
Hence, the tasks of the Raspberry Pi are: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item connecting to the drone's access point 
	using a Wi-Fi interface,
	\item controlling the drone 
	by executing Olympe to send low-level control signals 
	and to receive sensory data,
	\item applying the \gls{drl} model supported by 
	the command and control system,
	\item receiving high-level commands and sending video 
	frames to the command-control system from the drone camera.
\end{enumerate}
 
The Parrot \anafi drone is connected 
to the Raspberry Pi, which is the onboard computer,
using both devices' internal 
\SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz}
Wi-Fi interfaces. 
Firstly, we add the \anafi drone's access point 
to the saved devices list in the Raspberry Pi.
Once the Raspberry Pi boots up, it automatically keeps 
searching for the access point and connects 
to it once it is available.

For the connection between the command and control system 
and the Raspberry Pi, 
the Raspberry Pi will use a 
\SI[per-mode=symbol,per-symbol=p]{300}{MBps} 
Wi-Fi adapter dongle connected to 
its \textsc{usb} port. 
This will allow it to create an access point to which 
the command and control device will connect and by which 
the Raspberry Pi can be controlled. This control of the 
onboard computer is done through the graphical user interface,
which is simply a web-based application 
that will allow the user to send the
control commands and receive the video frames. 


Regarding the power source for the Raspberry Pi, 
we considered taking power directly from the 
drone's battery, but after some research, we found 
that the \anafi drone's  
socket is somehow different in the type and the power output. It is also challenging 
because the drone battery is susceptible to shutting down 
immediately if the voltage reaches less than 3.0 Volt. 
Therefore, we did not want to take the risk so we used a 
lithium battery with a power board called 
\textsc{upsp}ack Standard Power Supply attached to 
the main Raspberry Pi board. It includes a 
\SI{4000}{\milli\ampere\hour}
lithium battery, which provides enough power 
and long-lasting time for our application.
\Cref{tab:hardware-used} lists the hardware components
used in this project and their justifications. 

Finally, in \Cref{fig:3d-design} we have designed a 3D printed case that 
will hold all the components above the drone in 
a stylish and professional way. We have considered two 
points in the design. The first one is the weight and the minimal
complexity, as we have a limited payload that the drone 
can lift and a narrow space that can fit above the drone.
The second point is that the Raspberry Pi usually 
becomes hot due to processing and usage, so we need 
a design that will help the airflow go through and keep 
the ventilation process, and this is why we have 
the holes in the case design.

            approaches, the tradeoffs associated 
            with each approach, and your 
            justification for selecting a 
            particular approach. For instance, 
            selection of a particular 
            microcontroller for your design; what 
            were the main factors that contributed 
            to this specific choice. For example, 
            you may choose between Arduino, 
            MC68HCxxx, BasicStamp, and PIC18Fxx and 
            you have decided to use PIC18F47 due

        \item [\done] its low cost 

        \item [\done] its development platform availability 

        \item ability to input analog signals 
        \end{todolist}

\subsubsection{UAV options}
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\caption{A comparison of the \gls{uav} options.}
	\label{tab:alt-solutions}
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ p{4cm} X X }
		\toprule
		\textit{} & \textit{Option A} & \textit{Option B}\\ \midrule
		Type  & Custom made drone with onboard computer &

		Hard to customize or modify it since it flies under 
		limited protocols and standards. \\

		in our case its available in our hands and ready to fly.   \\
		
		Onboard computer & Must have & Must have \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table} 

In \cref{tab:alt-solutions}, 
we can see some trade-offs 
between option A and option B. However, in both designs, 
an onboard microcomputer must be present for 
flying control and the for the support of autopilot feature as well as for 
transmitting the video frames. 


Firstly, developing a custom drone will consume a lot of time and effort, 
which is different from our design project idea.
Hence, we have chosen the commercial drone option especially 
the Parrot \anafi for several reasons.
The face that it is supported by a continuously updated 
\textsc{sdk} and it can be controlled easily 
with a simple Python script which makes 
\gls{drl} development much easier and more stable are among common reasons/

Secondly, it has a good flight time 
as the \anafi drone has a 2700 mAh battery. 
It can fly up to 25 minutes, which is good enough 
for our application.
Finally, its support of Wi-Fi 802.11 and \gls{gps} 
features is essential in our project for 
executing scripts and navigation.

\subsubsection{Onboard-computers options}
There are three options for onboard microcomputers, 
which are shown in the following 
\cref{tab:onboard-computers}. Raspberry Pi 4 seems 
to be the best option since it has advantages 
in specifications, connection interfaces, 
and availability.

\subsubsection{Power Supply options}
As shown in \cref{tab:power-sources}, there are different options for
the raspberry pi power sources, we have chosen the second option
RPI pack because it is a complete package and lightweight compared 
to other options; availability was also another primary concern.

\subsection{Software design}

\begin{newrequirements}
    \begin{todolist}
    \item You should document the structural and 
        the behavioral aspects of your software 
        components. For projects that only use 
        embedded code (e.g., programming 
        microprocessor), a flow-chart 
        describing your software design could 
        be sufficient. Projects with user 
        interfaces may elaborate on the 
        functioning of the interface using some 
        of the models mentioned below. 

    \item The software components could be 
        documented using class diagram for the 
        whole system. While Class may be too 
        specific to JAVA or C++ environments, 
        you may use equivalent components 
        applicable to your design. For 
        instance, VI for LabVIEW designs, MDL 
        files in MATLAB, etc… If the model is 
        too big, partition the diagram using 
        some reasonable criteria.  For example, 
        you may provide the entity classes and 
        the controller classes as separate 
        diagrams. 

    \item Specific emphasis should be given to 
        the elaboration of the software 
        components that are responsible for 
        interfacing with the hardware 
        components of your design. For example, 
        if a protocol-like procedure was 
        developed in connecting to a hardware 
        module then it should be explained in 
        detail. Such components may include 
        packetization/depaketization 
        procedures, etc… 

    \item Wherever applicable, all associations 
        between classes/software-modules should 
        be identified through defining the 
        association name and the multiplicities 
        on both ends. Aggregation and 
        inheritance relationships should be 
        identified.  A brief explanation should 
        accompany each diagram. 

    \item Overall software logic may also be 
        described in order to know the 
        appropriate logic flow. In case of 
        LabVIEW or SIMULINK programs, this may 
        not be needed. For other programming 
        environments, the state diagram or 
        extended flow chart may be sufficient. 

    \item In case of graphical codes (such as 
        LabVIEW programs) the software 
        structure may be described by various 
        sub-Vis of the system. Similarly for 
        SIMULINK diagrams, the models should be 
        explained individually. The complete 
        program (graphical/text) should be 
        included in appendix and should not be 
        listed completely in this section.
