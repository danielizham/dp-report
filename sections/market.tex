\subsection{Business products}
        Technology and \textsc{ai} advancements have been changing human lives for the better.
	The possible opportunities for innovation and creativity are unlimited, this
	project has many aspects that could lead to business opportunities and commercial
	prototypes. 
	One of the many commercial products that could come out of this project is
	the \gls{drl} object detection model. This model can be used in any system
	that requires object detection, it could be a \gls{uav}, a \textsc{cctv} camera, or
	any system that inputs an image to the model after being trained on a similar 
	data set.
	Depending on the system, the \gls{drl} model could be trained using a different
	data set to detect a different object (e.g. cars, humans, animals).
	Another possible product is the \gls{drl} model responsible for navigating the
	drone after being trained on a specific movement pattern.
	Moreover, The entire system developed in this project is a viable product.
	
	According to \citeauthor{Atwater15Commercial}, the global market of drones is 
	increasingly becoming a key player in both military and civilian applications.
	The net value of the \glspl{uav} industry is estimated to reach 13 billion dollars
	by 2024, this is due to the efficiency and flexibility of \glspl{uav} in completing 
	various tasks.

\subsection{Interested parties}
	Many companies and stakeholders would be interested in acquiring either the
	complete system that we produce, or sub-parts (e.g. \gls{drl} model)
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Military applications: Drones and object detection models could 
		be used in military operations to detect people of danger, secure 
		sensitive areas, and even eliminate threats (i.e. drone weaponry).
		
		\item Biological research institutes, the \gls{uav} along with the object
		detection model that we provide could be trained to detect certain animals 
		and track them, this would revolutionize biological research.
		
		\item Security companies, personal home security could be established through
		\glspl{uav} and such object detection models could detect threats or unusual
		behaviors. This is applicable in any public area or even personal properties.		
		
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Viability in Qatar}
	Our product is simple enough to be used by anyone, however it is mostly intended for 
	authorized institutes that have a license to fly \glspl{uav} as the legal limitations 
	in the region are very strict. 
	A lot of the possible applications are for out of town use (e.g. biological research), 
	this makes the product more acceptable to the public as it does not invade anyone's privacy.
	Moreover, one of the major advantages for our product is that there are no competitors 
	inside Qatar, most drones in Qatar are used for photography purposes, and our
	specific product idea has never been deployed in Qatar, so this gives us an excellent 
	market headstart and implies the huge market need for such products.
\subsection{Product Price}
To choose an acceptable price, we must analyze the different components of the system. Their prices are listed in the \cref{tab:components-prices} below:
	\\
	\begin{table}[H]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{A price list of the system components.}

			\begin{tabular}{p{3.5cm} c c} 
                            \toprule
                            \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Price(\$)} & \textbf{Price(\textsc{qr})}\\
				\midrule
				\anafi Drone & 800.00 & 2920.00 \\
				Raspberry Pi & 150.00 & 547.50 \\
				Raspberry Pi battery & 30.00 & 109.50\\
				Wi-Fi Dongle & 20.00 & 73.00\\
				\hline 
				Total & 1000.00 & 3650.00 \\
				Selling price & 1644.00 & 6000 \\ 
				Profit/unit & 644.00 & 2350 \\
				\bottomrule
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}

	The discussed prices might not be acceptable by individuals, but the product is mainly made for big organizations who certainly can afford the product.
