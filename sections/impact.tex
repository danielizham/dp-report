\begin{newrequirements}
    \begin{todolist}
    \item [\done] Explain, as many as directly apply in 
        your project, the impact of your 
        engineered solution in a global, 
        economic, environmental and societal 
        context. For example: 

    \begin{todolist}
    \item [\done] Evaluate how your solution could 
        contribute to addressing global issues 
        such as climate change, poverty, 
        illiteracy, sustainable development and 
        human well-being. 

    \item [\done] Social impact relates to the capacity 
        of your project to create social and 
        cultural change on communities and 
        individuals. 

    \item [\done] For environmental, you may evaluate 
        real or perceived health and safety 
        issues associated with the use of your 
        system. 

    \item [\done] For economic, you may evaluate the 
        benefits and contribution of your 
        solution to the countryâ€™s economic 
        growth and economic competitiveness. 
        Also, you may evaluate the 
        manufacturability of your product (
        e.g., ease/difficulty of production). 
        Any specific issues and additional 
        costs? 
    \end{todolist}

    \item [\done] Use the following table to quantify the 
        significance of your design in the 
        above contexts. You may use a scale of: 
        \textit{low}, \textit{medium} and \textit{high}, 
        where you 
        identify the current status of the 
        contexts as \textit{no impact} and hence show 
        how high your work can impact on them
        (\textit{high} being extremely impactful while 
        \textit{low} being minor impact).

Our project has a huge impact on many different contexts, mainly the global, 
economical, environmental and societal context. The impact level and the 
project contribution are mentioned in \cref{tab:impact}.

            & Global 
        & The idea of this project could revolutionize the target visitation 
        issue. Many existing techniques could be replaced by \gls{rl} due to 
        its high efficiency. Also, the idea of using \glspl{uav} for target 
        tracking can revolutionize personal security and enhance the 
        well-being of humans. Moreover, our project contributes to the 
        research in the autonomous drone field, which is a revolutionary field 
        by itself and further studies could be built upon our ideas.

        existing jobs, and create numerous new ones. Also, the job of target 
        visitation and area tracking using drones could enhance homeland 
        security with minimal costs.

        drone-based object detection models in populated areas could increase 
        security levels as burglars or criminals would think twice before 
        committing any felonies, specially when the drones are incorporated
