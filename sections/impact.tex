Our project has a huge impact on many different contexts, mainly the global, 
economical, environmental and societal context. The impact level and the 
project contribution are mentioned in \cref{tab:impact}.

            & Global 
        & The idea of this project could revolutionize the target visitation 
        issue. Many existing techniques could be replaced by \gls{rl} due to 
        its high efficiency. Also, the idea of using \glspl{uav} for target 
        tracking can revolutionize personal security and enhance the 
        well-being of humans. Moreover, our project contributes to the 
        research in the autonomous drone field, which is a revolutionary field 
        by itself and further studies could be built upon our ideas.

        & The use of \glspl{uav} in different fields could replace many 
        existing jobs, and create numerous new ones. Also, the job of target 
        visitation and area tracking using drones could enhance homeland 
        security with minimal costs.

        & The targets could be animals that are in danger of extinction. 
        Tracking and studying the migration habits of these animals could save 
        them and help keep the environmental equilibrium.

        & Object detection is a sub-part of our project, and deploying 
        drone-based object detection models in populated areas could increase 
        security levels as burglars or criminals would think twice before 
        committing any felonies, specially when the drones are incorporated 
        with tracking systems.
