Our project has a many impacts and implications on different contexts, mainly 
the global, public, economical, environmental and social context. Further 
explanations about the different constraints are mentioned in 
\cref{tab:impact}.

	& Public Health, Safety, and Welfare
	& The idea of using \gls{rl} for target monitoring based on a mobility 
	pattern can further enhance home security. Also, \gls{rl} could be used to 
	monitor the security of large areas such as country borders.
	& People who live in vulnerable countries and unsafe neighborhoods could
	benefit a lot from our ideas and work as it can increase their safety 
	levels. \\
	
	\showimpactcounter
	& Global Implications
	& Many existing techniques for target visitation in numerous different 
	fields could be replaced by \gls{rl} due to its proven high efficiency. 
	& The idea of this project could revolutionize the target 
	visitation issue. Moreover, our project contributes to the 
	research in the autonomous drone field, which is a revolutionary field 
	by itself and further studies could be built upon our ideas. \\

	& Social Implications
	& Object detection is a sub-part of our project, and such object detction 
	models can be deployed within local neighborhoods which can result in 
	behavioral improvements.
	& A person's actions can change severely when they know they are being 
	watched, these behavioral changes are more likely to be positive. \\ 
	
	\showimpactcounter
	& Environmental Factors
	& The object detection model could be retrained to detect some 
	type of endangered animals. Also, their movement can be studied and 
	learned by an \gls{rl} model. 
	& Tracking and studying the migration habits of these animals could save 
	them and help keep the environmental equilibrium.  \\
	
	\showimpactcounter
	& Economic Factors  
	& Autonomous \glspl{uav} can increase security in large areas and replace 
	human beings who work long hours just to be present in a few locations. 
	& Increased security can have a huge economic benefit. The autonomous 
	drones field might end some jobs but it will surely create numerous new 
	ones.\\
