    \begin{todolist}
    \item Explain, as many as directly apply in 
        your project, the impact of your 
        engineered solution in a global, 
        economic, environmental and societal 
        context. For example: 

    \begin{todolist}
    \item Evaluate how your solution could 
        contribute to addressing global issues 
        such as climate change, poverty, 
        illiteracy, sustainable development and 
        human well-being. 

    \item Social impact relates to the capacity 
        of your project to create social and 
        cultural change on communities and 
        individuals. 

    \item For environmental, you may evaluate 
        real or perceived health and safety 
        issues associated with the use of your 
        system. 

    \item For economic, you may evaluate the 
        benefits and contribution of your 
        solution to the countryâ€™s economic 
        growth and economic competitiveness. 
        Also, you may evaluate the 
        manufacturability of your product (
        e.g., ease/difficulty of production). 
        Any specific issues and additional 
        costs? 
    \end{todolist}

    \item Use the following table to quantify the 
        significance of your design in the 
        above contexts. You may use a scale of: 
        \textit{low}, \textit{medium} and \textit{high}, 
        where you 
        identify the current status of the 
        contexts as \textit{no impact} and hence show 
        how high your work can impact on them
        (\textit{high} being extremely impactful while 
        \textit{low} being minor impact).
