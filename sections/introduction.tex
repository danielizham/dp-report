\subsection{Problem statement}

% # Describe the problem we are trying to solve
More often than not, individuals and organizations face the problem
of visiting a set of destinations in the fastest time possible
in order to carry out an observation.
For example, an operational engineer needs to monitor
a number of reactors and plants during his or her shift.
The need to do so in the fastest time can be due to restrictions in
cost, energy or other limited resources of concern.
This problem is commonly known as the Travelling Salesman problem
where historically, a salesman had to make a decision in which order
to visit a set of cities in the most time-saving manner to do his trade.
To achieve that goal, the destinations have to be visited in the order
that is the most efficient in terms of the metric of interest
and algorithms such as Dijkstra's have been successfully used 
to find the shortest path between the cities.
% ## visiting one destination - no problem at all since there is one way
% ## visiting multiple destinations in the fastest time possible - TSP
% ## why do we want to visit multiple destinations?
% ## what if the destinations/targets are moving in a straight line? 
% ## How do we visit those targets in the shortest time?
% ## what methods have been used? 

To accomplish that observation, ??? and this ???
found that using \glspl{uav}, or commonly known as drones,
can bring many benefits 
compared to the traditional methods.
Instead of going to the locations in person, installing a \textsc{cctv},
or using the satellite technology, a \gls{uav} can provide
the high resolution images or videos without 
having to be installed and maintained at that site
or being restricted to that specific location.
Moreover, the mobility of the \glspl{uav} is important
in cases where the destinations are actually mobile targets.
For instance, a marine biologist needs to investigate 
migrating pods of whales.
If such targets move in a straight line only,
then the problem can be formulated as an optimization problem
and may be solved using mixed integer programming.
However, if the mobility pattern of the targets is unknown,
then such solution will not work.
The problem that this project aims to solve is 
how to make a drone able to visit mobile targets 
given their historical locations in the fastest time
and in turn the most energy saving way. 
Particularly, this project aims to demonstrate the 
use of physics simulation in solving it. 
% ## Imagine if the way the targets are moving and the way the 
% ## the environment is affecting the uav is unknown or uncertain,
% ## now, what do we do.
% ## This is where rl and specifically drl excel. It will make the 
% ## uav figure it out by itself by trial and error.
% ## This project will implement a drl algorithm developed by 
% ## ?? et al. in a physics simulator to demonstrate the power/success 
% ## of drl in the mobile target visitation.

% # Differentiate between technical and non-technical challenges
To solve the aforementioned problem, 
there are many technical and non-technical challenges
that need to be dealt with.
Like many other engineering projects,
these challenges have forced us to make trade-offs.
The former category of challenges arises 
from the physical limitations of the drone used to
carry out the observation
and of the computer used to train the \gls{dl} models.
The main technical challenge when working with a drone
is its power supply which is battery powered due to its mobility. 
Other types of power supply such as the wireless power transfer
is also possible but infeasable since firstly, it is not the
focus of this project, and secondly, the technology requires 
advanced knowledge which cannot be gained within the duration 
of the design project.
This challenge is similarly faced with the Raspberry Pi attached
to the drone although its power usage is much lower compared to the drone.
The problem with the type of the power supply, in addition to its size, 
directly leads to a host of other technical challenges
such as short flying range and altitude, restricted flying time,
and low allowable payload.
Many of the challenges can be alleviated if the drone model is changed
from the Anafi 4K to a another one such as 
the Anafi Ai or the DJI Matrice 300 RTK,
but the cost and shipping logistics as well as
the likely issues with working with a new product
render this solution prohibitive.
% ### Flying range/altitude - The flying range of the Anafi is limited 
% ###           by the signal strength of the communication between the computer and the Raspberry Pi. Also, the altitude is dictated by the Anafi’s maximum height it can reach and the performance of the drone at a certain height.
% ### Flying time - The maximum flying time must be lower than the Anafi’s 25 minutes max flight lower than the Raspberry Pi’s ?? minutes
% ### Transmission delay - The delay in the communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Anafi must be acceptable
% ### Payload/weights - The Raspberry Pi with its peripherals should not exceed the maximum load the Anafi can carry.

In terms of the computer running the \gls{dl} training,
the technical challenge presents itself as 
the accuracy and cost tradeoff.
The drl model that the ?? etc. came up with 
is fixed and not big
but the object detection one is up to us.
For the object detection task, 
the depth and width of the model cannot be too big that
a normal data center cannot run although 
being big will improve
the model accuracy. In other words, we need to trade off
the accuracy for the size of the model 
for the maximum computational resources that we can handle. 
As a result of this, we will have to accept some misses
when the \gls{uav} is detecting the targets during the 
\gls{drl} training knowing that improving the accuracy will 
will not be possible given our limitations.
We estimate that the computer used to develop the \gls{drl} model
should have at least an Intel i5 10th generation or
Ryzen 4000 series \textsc{cpu}, and a \textsc{ram} of 8GB, 
and a \textsc{gpu} of at least an Nvidia 2000 series
with a \textsc{vram} of 12GB.
% ## technical challenges
% ### arise from the physical limitations of the Anafi drone system
% ### and the computer used to train the dl models.
% ### The Anafi drone model used is ??. The model has a storage
% ### and memory and there is no OS? There is a new Anafi AI
% ### which fully has what is required for our needs
% ### but due to its cost and logistical reasons as well as
% ### the likely issues with working with a new product made
% ### decide not to choose this route as a solution.
% ### The drl model that the ?? etc. came up with is fixed
% ### but the object detection is up to us.
% ### So the depth and width of the model cannot be too big that
% ### a normal data center can run although that will improve
% ### the model accuracy. In other words, we need to trade off
% ### the size and accuracy of the model 
% ### for the maximum computational resources that we can handle. 
% ### We estimate that the computer used to develop the drl model
% ### should have at least an intel i5 10th generation or
% ### Ryzen 4000 series, a GPU of at least the Nvidia 2000 series
% ### with a VRAM of 12GB and a RAM of 8GB.

% ### Power supply - The Anafi and the Raspberry Pi must be 
% ###                battery powered because they are mobile
% ### Flying range/altitude - The flying range of the Anafi is limited 
% ###           by the signal strength of the communication between the computer and the Raspberry Pi. Also, the altitude is dictated by the Anafi’s maximum height it can reach and the performance of the drone at a certain height.
% ### Flying time - The maximum flying time must be lower than the Anafi’s 25 minutes max flight lower than the Raspberry Pi’s ?? minutes
% ### Transmission delay - The delay in the communication between the Raspberry Pi and the Anafi must be acceptable
% ### Payload/weights - The Raspberry Pi with its peripherals should not exceed the maximum load the Anafi can carry.

As for the non-technical challenges, they are caused
by the practical considerations that comes 
from attempting to solve the problem.
One of the most important of them is cost. 
We have deliberated that
the resulting price for the stakeholders or clients
should not exceed \textsc{qar} 6000. 
This means that the fixed and variable costs of this project
coming from procuring the Anafi drone, the Raspberry Pi and other
components in the system, 
and wages for designing and training the model
should be around \textsc{qar} 4000 to make a 30\% profit 
which is our target.
A second non-technical challenge that we are required to consider
is the security in using an autonomous drone.
Specifically, the communication between Anafi-Raspberry Pi 
and Raspberry Pi-computer should be uninterrupted 
and secured against hacking and interference.
In addition, the drone must not invade the privacy 
of entities other than the targets
and the monitored targets 
must be acceptable by law to be tracked.
For a more in depth analysis of these challenges, 
please refer to \cref{sec:constraints}.

% ## non-technical challenges
% ### Economic - Cost needs be below budget. The stakeholders or clients
% ###    will not accept 
% ### Environmental	Light source - The Anafi requires good lighting to take pictures of the targets
% ### Security - The communication between Anafi-Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi-computer should be uninterrupted and secured against interference 
% ### Safety - The Anafi must know how to return to base should there be a discommunication with the computer
% ### Ethical - Privacy	The drone must not invade the privacy of the entities other than the targets
% ### Privacy - The monitored targets must be acceptable by law to be tracked
% ### Modularity - The system must be such that the DRL algorithm can be swapped with an improved one easily

\subsection{Project significance}

% # Project importance and uses

% ## Importance of  
% ## using a uav for mobile target visitation
% ## and using physics simulation to train it through drl:
% ### using uavs enjoys the high resolution images
% ### afforded by CCTV cameras 
% ### without its restriction in movement
% ### and the large-scale monitoring of satelites
% ### without its low accuracy.
% ### Target visitation done by a uav
% ### will eliminate the need 
% ### faster movements than other types of robots
% ### fewer obstacles
% ### Using drl will allow the uav to generalise better
% ### and perform bettern in unknown environment
% ### unknown targets' mobility pattern
% ### Using physics simulation will make the product 
% ### more accurate since it simulates environment noise
% ### so the drl model will take that into account when learning
% ### compared to a mathematical simulation
