The second important concept of the project is the computer simulation.
Simulation is a cheap and safe way to experiment with the drone
at the expense of reduction in accuracy compared to the real world.
The research realm shows that the use of simulation is highly attractive
in deep reinforcement learning studies with drones.
This is because Deep Reinforcement Learning involves
making gradual improvement to a model based on 
repeated cycles of experience, and computer simulation 
allows these iterations to be carried out cheaply.

According to the literature reviewed, 
Gazebo and ROS-PX4 are the most widely used software stack 
for the software-in-the-loop (\textsc{SITL}) development
because the pieces of software are open-source. 
In contrast, Sphinx and Olympe are used in this project 
which are closed-source.
Although open-source software in this case 
allows for full control and the flexibility to tinker,
it is less stable and time-consuming to debug
when there is a bug in the source code.
Another conclusion from the literature is that 
the transfer from simulation to the real world,
which this project aims to accomplish,
is lacking in the studies 
which means that the actual effectiveness is missing.
