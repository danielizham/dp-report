        1 & Simulation environment
            & Setup the environment and be familiar with the software and libraries that will be used.
        \\
        2 & Object detection model
            & Create dataset and start training the model then try to enhance it.
        \\
        3 & Research hardware interfacing and possible solutions
            & Collect information about possible hardware components and architectures to be used.
        \\
        4 & Literature review and related work
            & Start reading related work and previous papers related to our topic, compare, criticize, and summarize them.
        \\
        5 & Hardware architecture and implementation
            & Start grouping the components together and see what is missing and from where to get it.
        \\
        6 & Enhance the simulation environment
            & Apply the detection model and tweak the environment and improve it.
        \\
        7 & Hardware testing and proving design constraints parameters
            & Test the design constraints and push the drone and hardware components to the limit.
        \\
        8 & Report review and corrections
            & Write different sections in the report and review them.
        \\
        9 & Presentation
            & Create the presentation based on the report.

		\toprule
		\textit{Anticipated Risk} 
		& \textit{Description} 
		& \textit{Minimizing approach} \\
		
		\midrule
		
		Late delivery of the components 
		& Some components available online 
		and it takes time to arrive, 
		any delay will affect the hardware implementation.
		& Order early and from trusted sources with previous 
		customers reviews. \\
		
		Lose connection to the Raspberry Pi
		& Because we are connecting using Wi-Fi, maybe a connection loss 
		happen to due coverage or hardware issue.
		& Code a script to return the drone to the takeoff location 
		and do multiple tests to make sure we cover all the possible cases. \\
		
		Lose control of the drone
		& Because we are limited in fly time and battery capacity, 
		the drone can shut down immediately if no power reaches it.
		Another reason can be that software bugs and crashes can 
		result in unexpected behavior like flying in random directions.
		& For the fly time, we will make sure we land the drone before it reaches the flight time constraints.
		We will create a handlers script for the software crashes 
		to ensure that Raspberry Pi gets the control again.  \\
		
		Flying drone outdoor without permissions 
		& Qatar has very restricted rules regarding flying a drone 
		with a camera outdoor.
		& Get the required permissions to fly the drone in 
		Al-Khor airport or fly it indoors inside the university with permission from the department. \\

                Mismatch between the development and 
                simulation environments
                & The development platforms for Sphinx, Olympe
                and \gym may not use the same \gls{os}
                and libraries as running them. For example,
                developing plugins for Sphinx has to be done
                on Ubuntu 16.04 only, but running it can be
                done on Ubuntu 18.04.
                & Use Docker to run a suitable container 
                for the development platforms.
                \\

                Accidental premature termination of the 
                training
                & The \gls{rl} training can last for a few
                days. Many things can happen during that
                period such as forgetting to plug in the
                power supply, and sudden shutdown of
                the laptop due to overheating.
                & Save checkpoints of the weights and
                the last learning rate from time to time
                so that the training can be resumed from
                the point before the termination.
