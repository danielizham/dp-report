		\midrule
		
		Late delivery of the components 
		& Some components available online 
		and it takes time to arrive, 
		any delay will affect the hardware implementation.
		& order early and from trusted sources with previous 
		customers reviews. \\
		
		Lose connection to the Raspberry Pi
		& Because we are connecting using Wi-Fi, maybe a connection loss 
		happen to due coverage or hardware issue.
		& code a script to return the drone to the takeoff location 
		and do multiple tests to make sure we cover all the possible cases. \\
		
		Lose control of the drone
		& Because we are limited in fly time and battery capacity, 
		the drone can shut down immediately if no power reaches it.
		Another reason can be that software bugs and crashes can 
		result in unexpected behavior like flying in random directions.
		& For the fly time, we will make sure we land the drone before it reaches the flight time constraints.
		We will create a handlers script for the software crashes 
		to ensure that Raspberry Pi gets the control again.  \\
		
		Flying drone outdoor without permissions 
		& Qatar has very restricted rules regarding flying a drone 
		with a camera outdoor.
		& get the required permissions to fly the drone in 
		Al-Khor airport or fly it indoors inside the university with permission from the department. \\
