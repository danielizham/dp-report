I learned many lessons from this project such as appreciating 
the time and never postponing any task, this will lead to smooth 
the progress of any project and will make my the tasks look 
easy and simple. Another lesson learned is you learn from 
your failures, I heard this lesson in many quotations but I 
didn't believe in it until I faced that failure in doing some of 
my tasks and when I face a similar problem, I solve it 
immediately and with confidence.

For the professional skills, I gained experience in the hardware 
section and microcontrollers which boosted my confidence which 
was low before the project, this experience will help me in 
future research and the projects that I am planning to do after 
I graduate. 
Web development skill was one of my interests, 
unfortunately, as a computer engineer, I didn't take any web 
development course but this project gave me the chance to learn 
and apply the basics blocks that am aiming to improve 
and advance in the future. 
Make use of programs and services that simplify
your work, such as GitHub which have been used to share the 
Latex files and the code needed to write this report.
Another critical skill that I gained 
are the basics of writing a scientific paper and I want to 
appreciate Dr.Amr who illustrated how to divide the sections of 
the paper and the main mistakes that people fall into so that 
we can avoid them.

About the technical skills, I learned from the multiple meetings how to 
approach the problem from different sides and how to find the 
the best solution for it. Also, I learned to be more responsible
and professional by finally getting rid of one of my bad behavior 
which is procrastination.

Avoid getting distracted from the main goal or objective in 
future projects, in the first semester I wasted 2-3 weeks 
on tasks that I thought it's important to the project but 
I found that they are not so analyzing the tasks and 
order their importance is an important thing before
you start any one of them.

Teamwork experience is a nice lesson to learn and 
there are different kinds of team members and team roles.
I learned to fill the gaps and how to fit myself in different 
positions to boost the progress of the project. 
Finally, communication skills are very crucial to make smooth 
the flow of the work and to deliver what is required accurately.
