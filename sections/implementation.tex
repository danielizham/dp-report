    \item Actual Design description with pictures 
        and diagrams. E.g., a “wiring diagram” 
        of the implemented hardware can be 
        added. 

    \item Actual images of various modules must 
        be included wherever possible. 
        Otherwise, at least the images of 
        various aspects of the completed design 
        must be shown. 

    \item List the different tools and framework 
        used for the implementation. 

    \item Discuss any novel aspects of your 
        implementation (if applicable). You may 
        link this aspect of your design to the 
        comparison table at the end of 
        literature review and elaborate on the 
        steps taken in achieving these 
        novelties in your design. 

    \item Discuss the challenges encountered 
        during the implementation and how they 
        were addressed. 

    \item You may organize any of the above 
        recommended points as subsections
