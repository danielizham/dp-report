        Power supply  
            & The Anafi and the Raspberry Pi must be 
            battery powered because they are mobile 
            (with ?? voltages DC/mAh)  \\

        Flying range/altitude 
            & The flying range of the Anafi is limited 
            by the signal strength of the communication 
            between the computer and the Raspberry Pi. 
            Also, the altitude is dictated by the Anafi’s 
            maximum height it can reach and the performance 
            of the drone at a certain height. \\

        Flying time  
            & The maximum flying time must be lower than 
            the Anafi’s 25 minutes max flight lower than 
            the Raspberry Pi’s ?? minutes \\ 

        Transmission delay  
            & The delay in the communication between 
            the Raspberry Pi and the Anafi must be acceptable \\

        Payload/weights  
            & The Raspberry Pi with its peripherals should not 
            exceed the maximum load the Anafi can carry. \\

        Security 
            & Communication 
                & The communication between Anafi-Raspberry Pi

        Ethical 
            & Privacy

        Ethical 
            & Law-abiding

    \item[1.6] Respect privacy of the people and their 
        properties and collect/train data after confirmations.
    \item[1.7] The client's data and information, which is gathered 
        to make the product consisting of the model along with 
        the drone kit, should be kept confidential except in cases 
        where the application violates the law, 
        organizational regulations or the Code.
    \item[2.3] Usage of product/services should be under 
        the local and international laws and regulations. 
        For example, you need a license to fly a drone in Qatar.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Obstacle-free environment
    \item Windless environment
    \item The targets move according to one of the mobility patterns
    \item The physical Anafi performs identically to the simulated Anafi
    \item The Anafi captures the required/full details of the target 
        when it takes the target’s picture
    \item Similarly, when it takes the target’s picture, 
        it is assumed the task at hand 
        (e.g. criminal tracking, smart farming, search and rescue, etc.) 
        is accomplished.
