        Power supply  
            & The Anafi and the Raspberry Pi must be 
            battery powered because they are mobile 
            (with ?? voltages DC/mAh)  \\

        Flying range/altitude 
            & The flying range of the Anafi is limited 
            by the signal strength of the communication 
            between the computer and the Raspberry Pi. 
            Also, the altitude is dictated by the Anafi’s 
            maximum height it can reach and the performance 
            of the drone at a certain height. \\

        Flying time  
            & The maximum flying time must be lower than 
            the Anafi’s 25 minutes max flight lower than 
            the Raspberry Pi’s ?? minutes \\ 

        Transmission delay  
            & The delay in the communication between 
            the Raspberry Pi and the Anafi must be acceptable \\

        Payload/weights  
            & The Raspberry Pi with its peripherals should not 
            exceed the maximum load the Anafi can carry. \\

        Security 
            & Communication 
                & The communication between Anafi-Raspberry Pi 
                and Raspberry Pi-computer should be uninterrupted 
                and secured against interference \\

        Ethical 
            & Privacy

        Ethical 
            & Law-abiding
