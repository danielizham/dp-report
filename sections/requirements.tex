\subsection{Functional requirements}

In order to achieve the objectives listed
in \cref{sec:objectives}, the following activities 
and operations should be expected by the user 
and the \gls{uav} system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The users of the system are authorized
        individuals and organizations to track, monitor or survey
        some moving objects.
    \item The user should supply the 
        profile of the targets 
        and their movement details/patterns
        to us for the \gls{rl}.
    \item The user should receive 
        an \anafi-Raspberry Pi-\gls{drl} 
        model bundle after a maximum of 3 months.
    \item The system should take pictures, capture videos
        or record other physical properties using
        suitable sensors of the intended
        targets according to the needs
        of the user.
    \item The user should receive some 
        guidance and support 
        to handle the system.
    \item The user should agree on 
        the terms and conditions 
        which limit the type of users.
    \item The system should only allow 
        authorized users 
        to view the collected pictures and 
        data from the \anafi system.
    \item The users must not be allowed to access 
        the source code.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design constraints}

The following are the restrictions that have been imposed
on our component, technology and technique selections 
due to the nature of 
the devices we have chosen to use 
and the environmental elements the drone will 
fly around.

\begin{table}[H]

    \label{tab:technical-design-constraints}
    \begin{tabular}{ p{2.8cm} p{12.2cm} }

        \textit{Name} 
            & \textit{Description} \\

        \midrule

        Power supply  
            & The \anafi drone and the Raspberry Pi must be 
            battery powered because they are mobile 
            (\SI{2700}{\milli\ampere\hour} 
            for the \anafi drone and 
            \SI{4000}{\milli\ampere\hour} 
            for the Raspberry Pi)~\cite{Par19}.  \\

        Flying range 
            & The maximum flying range of the 
            \anafi drone is 
            \SI{90}{\meter}
            \tobedone{Test this} from the computer. 
            This is limited by the maximum distance
            the Wi-Fi signal can reach between 
            the computer and the Raspberry Pi. \\

        Altitude 
            & The flying altitude must fall 
            between \tobedone{Check in the simulation} 
            \SIrange{3}{9}{\meter} 
            or the 
            \SI{1 x 1.64}{\meter}
            cell in focus either 
            is not covered by the \gls{fov} in its
            entirety or the \gls{fov} covers too much
            of the surrounding cells.
            The minimum and maximum altitudes 
            were determined based on the 
            normal and 2.8\texttimes\ digital zoom
            of the \anafi drone's camera. \\

        Flying duration
            & The maximum flying duration is 
            \SI{15}{\minute}
            as the battery is drained by 
            \SI{10}{\percent}
            on average in 
            \SI{1.5}{\minute} 
            when it is flown with a payload of 
            \SI{190}{\gram}.
            This means that the target visitation
            mission needs to be completed under 
            this time 
            (the Raspberry Pi can last for 
            \SI{4}{\hour} 
            under normal operations). \\ 

        Response time
            & The time between a command sent by 
            the computer, the \anafi drone 
            starting to execute it, and finally
            the computer receiving the confirmation
            of the execution must be
            below 
            \SI{1}{\second}. 
            This is to ensure the commands
            do not overlap causing any of them
            to be ignored. \\

        Payload  
            & The Raspberry Pi with its peripherals 
            must not exceed 
            \SI{200}{\gram}, 
            which is the maximum payload mass 
            of the \anafi drone. \\

                to be swapped with another one trained for
                the new task. \\

\subsection{Professional code of ethics}

\noindent
In accordance with the \gls{ieee} Code of Ethics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[I-7] Stakeholders and users 
        should accept our terms and services which include 
        avoiding injuring others and their property 
        and protecting the privacy of others.
    \item[II-7] Stakeholders and users should not use our product 
        or service to discriminate any
        part of the community according 
        to their race, religion, etc.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In accordance with the \gls{acm} Code of Ethics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.6] Respect privacy of the people and their 
        properties and collect/train data after confirmations.
    \item[1.7] The client's data and information, which is gathered 
        to make the product consisting of the model along with 
        the drone kit, should be kept confidential except in cases 
        where the application violates the law, 
        organizational regulations or the Code.
    \item[2.3] Usage of product/services should be under 
        the local and international laws and regulations. 
        For example, you need a license to fly a drone in Qatar.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}

The following states are assumed to be true
since the design decisions to meet the opposite
conditions fall outside the scope of this project.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The environment is obstacle-free and windless.
    \item The targets move according to one 
        of the mobility patterns only.
    \item The physical \anafi drone performs 
        identically to the simulated \anafi drone.
    \item The \anafi drone captures the 
        required details of the target 
        when it takes the targetâ€™s picture.
    \item Having taken all of the targets' pictures 
        is equivalent to accomplishing the task at hand 
        (e.g. criminal tracking, smart farming, 
        search and rescue, etc.).
    \item The \anafi drone is fully charged before 
        initiating each target visitation task,
        which is completed before the drone
        runs out of battery.
    \item The \anafi drone always flies within the
        maximum range in case the computer needs
        to send an abort-mission command.
    \item The Wi-Fi connection between the \anafi drone
        and its onboard computer (Raspberry Pi)
        does not drop and is strong at all times.
    \item The security mechanisms used by the \anafi
        drone are enough to protect it against
        any virtual and physical attacks.
