    \begin{todolist}
    \item Identify areas of improvement in the 
        project and features of interest that 
        can be added later on. 

    \item How the solution shortcomings could be 
        addressed? 

    \item What things could be done better? 

    \item What additional resources are required 
        to implement the extended / not-
        implemented design or features?

\subsection{Hardware}
Many improvements can be added to the hardware section in future work,
such as upgrading the raspberry pi memory version to 8 GB because in future improvements
adding more complex models, mobility patterns, and features will consume more memory 
and 4 GB will not be sufficient for that.
Also, extend the raspberry pi power-supply battery and replace it after
using it for a while because its life cycle started to decrease after every full charge period. 

Another improvement is to use the new Parrot
ANAFI Ai comes with many professional features and enhancements such as longer 
battery life, 
more secure protocols, competent navigation, and finally, the essential part is the 
support of 4G connection.
This feature will make the connection between our command and control system and the
drone very convenient and easy, without the need of the on-board computer, 
but there are some drawbacks, such as the price of the drone and availability.
